# Neural connectivity tools
GLM tools for inferring connectivity in neural spike train data

Data assumed to be given as matrix of binned spikes

Currently implements:
* Standard GLM framework
* Granger causality 
* low dimensional latent and sparse connectivity framework (based on Pfau, Paninski 2013)
